	abstract = {Plant defense responses involve several biological processes that allow plants to fight against pathogenic attacks. How these different processes are orchestrated within organs and depend on specific cell types is poorly known. Here, using scRNA-seq technology on three independent biological replicates, we identified 10 distinct cell populations in wild-type Arabidopsis leaves inoculated with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. Among those, we retrieved major cell types of the leaves (mesophyll, guard, epidermal, companion and vascular S cells) to which we could associate characteristic transcriptional reprogramming and regulators, thereby specifying different cell-type responses to the pathogen. Further analyses of transcriptional dynamics, based on inference of cell trajectories, indicated that the different cell types, in addition to their characteristic defense responses, can also share similar modules of gene reprogramming, allowing for instance vascular S cells, epidermal cells and mesophyll cells to converge towards an identical cell fate, mostly characterized by lignification and detoxification functions. Moreover, it appeared that the defense responses of these three cell types can evolve along a second separate path. As this divergence does not correspond to the differentiation between immune and susceptible cells, we speculate that this might reflect the discrimination between cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous responses. Altogether our data provide an upgraded framework to describe, explore and explain the specialization and the coordination of plant cell responses upon pathogenic challenge.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Interactions between plant pathogens and other plant-associated microorganisms regulate disease. Deciphering the networks formed by these interactions, termed pathobiomes, is crucial to disease management. Our aim was to investigate whether microbial association networks inferred from metabarcoding data give relevant insights into pathobiomes, by testing whether inferred associations contain signals of ecological interactions. We used Poisson Lognormal Models to construct microbial association networks from metabarcoding data and then investigated whether some of these associations corresponded to interactions measurable in co-cultures or known in the literature, by using grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and the fungal pathogen causing powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) as a model system. Our model suggested that the pathogen species was associated with 23 other fungal species, forming its putative pathobiome. These associations were not known as interactions in the literature, but one of them was confirmed by our co-culture experiments. The yeast Buckleyzyma aurantiaca impeded pathogen growth and reproduction, in line with the negative association found in the microbial network. Co-cultures also supported another association involving two yeast species. Together, these findings indicate that microbial networks can provide plausible hypotheses of ecological interactions that could be used to develop microbiome-based strategies for crop protection.}
