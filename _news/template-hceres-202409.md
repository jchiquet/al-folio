Happy to share a [quarto template for HCERES report](https://github.com/jchiquet/quarto-hceres), based on a home-made LaTex sheet and Pandoc, that let you include gently markdown, code, equation, on-the-fly plots and let you handle bibliographical items extracted from HAL with BibLaTeX. Easy to install with the quarto installer.

This was clearly the most exciting part of writing the report for my laboratory. I hope this helps some colleagues, so please feel free to use and contribute.
