Happy to share a [quarto template for HCERES report](https://github.com/jchiquet/quarto-hceres), based on a home-made LaTeX sheet and Pandoc, which allows you to smoothly include markdown, code, equations, plots on the fly and manage bibliographic elements extracted from HAL with BibLaTeX. Easy to install with the quarto installer.

[The rendered document is here ](https://jchiquet.github.io/quarto-hceres/), rendered by CI with gh-actions, if you want a quick look.

This was clearly the most exciting part of writing the report for my laboratory. I hope this helps some colleagues, so please feel free to use and contribute.
